Much like the phoenix in Greek Mythology, This project is going though a rebirth.

Similar to the transformation from the Quasar Universe to the Pulsar Project, this version will see tons of new organisations, species, factions and technologies added.

Unlike the previous transformations, instead of focusing on adding new stuff, this update will see the rebirth of old ideas, brought up to date with the new ones.

This is why instead of continuing with the current naming strategy, "Quasar Universe -> Pulsar Project -> *Next Update*", this will instead see the rebranding of the Pulsar Project into the "Pulsar Project: *Phoenix Edition* = An attempt to connect old ideas to the new ones."
